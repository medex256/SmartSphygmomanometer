# SmartSphygmomanometer
Smart semi-automatic Sphygmomanometer which is implemented by using microbit. It can measure person's blood pressure and heart beat rate.

## Outline of a project

 - Measure the blood pressure and heart rate automatically once the data is well-received.

 - Enhance the user’s awareness and experience throughout the measurement.

 - Find the adaptive range of result based on the user’s input to verify whether it is normal or not.

 - Handle the errors and exceptions during the automatic measurement without instant crash or quit.

 - Understand how to prepare and store the data for easier data processing without the data overflow and memory limit exceeds.
